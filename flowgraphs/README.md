# Loopback

The smallest end-to-end M2K flowgraph, and the first thing to run at a
station. **Wire W1 to 1+, and ground to 1-.**

| file | uses |
| --- | --- |
| `m2k_loopback.grc` | the stock gr-iio blocks — works with nothing installed |
| `m2k_loopback_generated.grc` | blocks `iio_grc.py` generated from a capture |

```
gnuradio-companion flowgraphs/m2k_loopback.grc
```

For the generated variant, point GRC at the blocks first:

```
uv run ./iio_grc.py fixtures/m2k-real.json --out blocks/
GRC_BLOCKS_PATH=$PWD/blocks gnuradio-companion flowgraphs/m2k_loopback_generated.grc
```

## The two conversion blocks are the lesson

gr-iio carries **short** samples in both directions — raw ADC counts, not
volts. So `Short To Float` gets you a number, and `Multiply Const` turns
that number into volts. That multiply is the entire counts-to-volts story
in one block, and `volts_per_count` is the variable it lives in.

Everything upstream of that multiply is counts. Everything downstream is
volts. If a participant remembers one thing about IIO, this is a good
candidate.

## What has been checked, and what has not

Verified without hardware, in the test suite (`tests/test_grc_integration.py`),
against GNU Radio 3.10 itself rather than against our own assumptions:

- GRC's real block loader accepts all five generated blocks
- both flowgraphs validate in GRC and generate Python that parses
- the emitted constructors are the shapes we claim:
  `device_source(..., buffer_size, decimation - 1)` and
  `device_sink(..., buffer_size, interpolation - 1, cyclic)`, each followed
  by `set_len_tag_key()`
- an untouched dropdown writes nothing — "shown" never means "set"
- run headless, both get as far as `RuntimeError: Unable to create context`,
  which is the only step that needs a board

Not checked, and the reason to run this at a bench:

- **`volts_per_count = 0.014525`** comes from libm2k's `getScalingFactor()`
  for the ±25 V range. No signal has confirmed it. Put a known amplitude in
  and see whether the plot agrees.
- **`oversampling_ratio` as decimation.** `samp_rate` assumes the ADC's
  100 MS/s divided by 100. If that is wrong, every frequency axis is wrong
  by the same ratio.
- **`amplitude_counts = 1000`** is a guess at a safe DAC level.

## A GRC trap worth knowing

Keep the flowgraph `description` to a single line. GRC comments out only its
first line when generating Python and drops the rest in as bare code, which
does not parse. Multi-line notes belong in `comment`. There is a test pinning
this.

# SPI loopback

A real SPI bus bit-banged out of three DIO pins and read back on three
more. There are two flowgraphs. They wire up the same way, decode the
same way, and differ only in what makes the waveform:

| | |
|---|---|
| `m2k_spi_loopback.grc` | **Send on demand.** Type in a box, press Enter, one transaction goes out. The bus rests at idle in between. |
| `m2k_spi_loopback_continuous.grc` | **Repeat forever.** One frame in a cyclic buffer, played by the hardware on a loop. |

Start with the interactive one — it is what a participant expects a bus
to do. The continuous one is the older of the two, is the one with
hardware evidence behind it, and is the better thing to leave running
while you talk over a trace.

**Three jumpers, both flowgraphs:**

```
DIO0 -> DIO4      SCLK
DIO1 -> DIO5      MOSI
DIO2 -> DIO6      CS
```

Those six pins are a choice, not a constraint — each line has its own
dropdown, so any six free DIO pins in any order work as well. Contiguous
is what the workshop ships because it is what twenty people can wire
without a diagram.

```
export GRC_BLOCKS_PATH=$PWD/gr-m2k/grc:$GRC_BLOCKS_PATH
export PYTHONPATH=$PWD/gr-m2k:$PYTHONPATH
gnuradio-companion flowgraphs/m2k_spi_loopback.grc
```

## Send on demand — `m2k_spi_loopback.grc`

**QT GUI Message Edit Box** → **M2K SPI Encode** → **Digital Sink**. Type
something, press Enter, and the message goes out exactly once. Encode
holds the whole waveform: it turns a message into three streams of levels
and produces idle — clock low, data low, CS released — for as long as the
sink asks, so the sink never starves between messages.

**The Digital Source here is free-running, not triggered.** That is the
one thing that differs from the continuous flowgraph, and it is not a
style choice. gr-iio's `device_source` returns `WORK_DONE` from `work()`
on *any* refill error, so an armed trigger that times out waiting for the
next message ends the source for good: the first message decodes, and
everything after it goes out on the wire with nothing left to read it
back. The block has a `set_timeout_ms` but in 3.10 the value is stored
and never handed to libiio, and no timeout would be long enough anyway —
the wait is however long it takes somebody to type.

Nothing is lost by dropping it. The decoder emits nothing until it has
seen a falling CS, so CS frames the stream in software, which is what
that rule was written for. The QT time sink does the display triggering
instead: normal mode, negative slope, on the CS channel.

Two more settings make send-on-demand work, and they go together:

- **The sink is not cyclic.** A cyclic buffer is pushed once and repeated
  by the hardware forever; nothing downstream can gate it. Send-on-demand
  needs streaming.
- **Encode's "Align frames to" is set to the sink's `buffer_len`.** A
  non-cyclic sink hands the board one DMA buffer at a time and the board
  need not join them seamlessly, so a frame lying across a buffer seam can
  be torn in the middle. Encode counts the samples it produces, and that
  count *is* the sink's position in its buffer, so it can hold a queued
  frame until the next boundary and start it there. The cost is up to one
  buffer of latency — 160 ms here, which nobody pressing a key notices.
  `buffer_len` must exceed the longest frame, `128 + 16*half*bytes`.

`samp_rate` is **100 kS/s**, not the 1 MS/s the continuous flowgraph uses.
Non-cyclic digital streaming underruns at 1 MS/s about half the runs. An
underrun while the bus is idle is harmless; one mid-frame corrupts the
message. At 100 kS/s the bus is still 6.25 kHz at `half = 8`.

`half`, the pin dropdowns and the four timing parameters behind
*Advanced* mean the same thing here as anywhere else.

## Repeat forever — `m2k_spi_loopback_continuous.grc`

Three vector sources hold one frame, repeating. A frame is one whole SPI
transaction: idle, CS low, every byte of `spi_message` clocked out back
to back, CS high again. The Digital Sink plays the three lists as one
cyclic buffer at 1 MS/s; with 8 samples per half-clock that is a 62.5 kHz
bus in SPI mode 0. The Digital Source triggers on **CS falling** on DIO6,
so every capture starts at the beginning of a message, and **M2K SPI
Decode** turns the three streams back into the bytes that went out.
Message Debug prints them.

**Type into the `SPI message` box while it runs.** Press Enter and the
string goes out on the next buffer -- GRC generates a callback that
recomputes the three sample lists and hands them to the vector sources
with `set_data()`.

That only works because the frame length is fixed. `spi_capacity` (8
bytes) sets it, not the message: a short message is padded out with idle
samples, CS already high, which the decoder skips. The sink's buffer
size is a constructor argument with no callback, so a frame that grew
with the message would stop dividing the buffer the moment someone typed
a longer one -- and a message spliced across a buffer boundary is the
section 11 failure again. Anything past `spi_capacity` is cut; raise it
and restart to send more.

**CS is asserted once per message, not once per byte.** Both decode, and
per-byte framing is what a first draft naturally produces -- but the M2K's
capture is gapped between buffers, and the source re-arms on each one. If
CS falls once per byte, the arming edge is a *byte* boundary, so every
buffer starts on whichever byte it happened to land on and Message Debug
prints rotations: `M2K`, then `2KM`, then `KM2`, every byte individually
correct. One assertion per message makes the only falling edge in the
frame the start of the message. Section 11 of `docs/bench-checklist.md`
has the numbers.

### The frame is a variable, which is the point

```python
spi_bytes = [ord(ch) for ch in str(spi_message)[:spi_capacity]]
spi_bits  = [[(byte >> (7 - i)) & 1 for i in range(8)] for byte in spi_bytes]
n, pad    = len(spi_bytes), 16*half*(spi_capacity - len(spi_bytes))
spi_sclk  = ([0]*72 + ([0]*half + [1]*half)*(8*n) + [0]*(56 + pad))
spi_mosi  = ([0]*64 + [spi_bits[0][0] if spi_bits else 0]*8
             + [b for bits in spi_bits for bit in bits for b in [bit]*(2*half)]
             + [0]*(56 + pad))
spi_cs    = ([1]*64 + [0]*(16 + 16*half*n) + [1]*(48 + pad))
```

Change `spi_message` and the waveform changes, live. Change `half` and the
bus speed changes — `frame` is `128 + 16*half*spi_capacity`, `repeats` is
`16384 // frame`, and the buffer stays a whole number of frames. `half`
still needs a restart, because `frame` moves with it. A participant can see
mode 0's rule — MOSI settles while the clock is low, the receiver samples
on the rising edge — directly in the list, which is harder to get from a
datasheet timing diagram.

The three lists are all the same length, and they have to be: they are
one buffer, and a short one would shift the others.

## Chip select is doing more than it looks like

The decoder emits **nothing** until it has seen a falling CS, and that
rule is worth a minute of the session. On a bus there is no start bit.
If a capture happens to begin in the middle of a frame, some unknown
number of bits are already gone — and the next eight still make a byte,
one that is real, plausible and wrong. Dropping the partial frame is the
only way to tell "I missed the start" from "here is your data."

Bits left over when CS releases go the same way rather than being padded
out to a byte.

## Reading the output

Message Debug prints the bytes twice — once as characters, once as hex:

```
((text . M2K))
pdu length =          3 bytes
pdu vector contents =
0000: 4d 32 4b
```

The payload is the words that were actually on the wire; the text rides
in the metadata, which is Scopy's text column and the quickest way for
somebody to see that what they typed is what came back. Bytes outside
printable ASCII show as `\xNN`. Turn *Text in metadata* off on a bus
that is not carrying text.

## What has been checked

On hardware, 2026-09-02: 0xA5 first try, then eight edge-case bytes,
then all 256 byte values in a single 65536-sample capture, three repeat
runs, 768 frames, zero errors — decoded offline by `bench/spi_loopback.py`.
Section 9 of `docs/bench-checklist.md` has the detail.

The in-flowgraph decoder passed section 11 on 2026-09-04: whole-message
frames at three bus speeds, about 6 M samples each, `M2K` repeating with
no rotation and no ragged chunk. `tests/test_spi_decode.py` evaluates the
continuous flowgraph's own variables to confirm the message it declares
is the message that comes back; `tests/test_spi_encode.py` round-trips
the encoder through the decoder, including the alignment rule.

The interactive flowgraph passed section 12 on the board on 2026-09-04:
twenty sends with varying text, one print per press, no rotations,
nothing dropped, no timeout. Non-cyclic streaming and frame alignment
both hold at 100 kS/s, and a free-running capture is *not* gapped
between rx buffers — the gap section 11 found belongs to the trigger
re-arming. The one number still missing is how far `samp_rate` can come
back up before it stops holding.

The continuous flowgraph must stay cyclic. Non-cyclic underruns at 1 MS/s
and loses about half its runs.

One Digital Sink per flowgraph — all sixteen pins share one output word
and one DMA buffer.
