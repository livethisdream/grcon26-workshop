"""M2K Digital Source and Sink -- the 16 DIO pins.

Three IIO devices are involved and none of them is optional:

    m2k-logic-analyzer      per-pin configuration. `direction` decides
                            whether a pin is an input or an output, and
                            it lives HERE, not on either data device.
                            So does `raw`, the idle level.
    m2k-logic-analyzer-rx   the samples coming in, and the trigger.
    m2k-logic-analyzer-tx   the samples going out.

A pin is an input or an output, never both, so a source and a sink in
the same flowgraph must share no pin. Each block takes its own list --
`pins=[3, 7, 1]` -- and that list is the port order, not merely a set:
port 0 carries whichever pin you named first. Each block writes
`direction` for its own pins at construction, so where two lists DO
overlap, whichever is built last wins and the other block silently
reads or drives nothing.

Nothing here is protocol-aware. Three lines are three lines; whether
they are SPI's clock, data and select or a latch strobe beside a data
bus is the business of whatever block reads them next. Lines may be
named -- `names=['SCLK', 'MOSI', 'CS']` -- and the names change no
behaviour whatever. They only mean a mistake reports itself as
`MOSI (DIO7)` instead of `DIO7`, which is the difference between a
wiring error you can see and one you have to go and look up.

An output pin has two sources of truth. The stream drives it while the
flowgraph runs; `raw` drives it the rest of the time, and the pin snaps
back to `raw` the moment the flowgraph stops. The sink's idle level sets
`raw`, which is both Scopy's Digital IO and the only way to say what the
pins should do when nothing is playing.

One port per pin, carrying one bit per sample in a short. That is
gr-iio's model, not a choice made here: each DIO pin is its own IIO
channel with a 1-bit scan element.

Those sixteen channels are not sixteen samples. They are sixteen 1-bit
fields inside ONE 16-bit word, each at a shift equal to its pin number,
and this is why the sink does not use gr-iio's device_sink. See
`_packed_sink` for the whole story; the short version is that
device_sink writes each channel with a full-width store to the same
address, so every pin erases the one before it and only the highest
survives. The sink here packs the word itself and writes raw bytes.

The source has no such problem -- reading a shared word and handing out
one bit per port is exactly what libiio's demux does correctly -- so
`digital_source` is plain gr-iio.

    gr-iio's device_sink cannot drive more than one DIO pin, and it does
    not say so -- it reports success and the extra pins simply never
    move. This block exists to work around that, so it is worth writing
    down why, because the failure is invisible from the outside.

    The sixteen logic-analyzer channels are not sixteen samples side by
    side. They are sixteen 1-bit fields inside ONE 16-bit word, each at
    a shift equal to its pin number, which is why `iio_buffer_step` is 2
    bytes whether you enable one channel or all sixteen. libiio knows
    this; `iio_buffer_first` hands back the SAME address for every one
    of them.

    device_sink's inner loop then does:

        for each channel i:
            iio_channel_convert_inverse(chan[i], dst, src[i])

    and convert_inverse is a full-width store, not a read-modify-write.
    So channel i+1 writes its own bit and zeroes every other bit in the
    word, erasing channel i. Measured on the bench:

        ch0 <- 1,1,1,1   buffer = 0100 0100 0100 0100
        ch1 <- 0,0,0,0   buffer = 0000 0000 0000 0000
        ch1 <- 1,1,1,1   buffer = 0200 0200 0200 0200

    Only the last channel in the list survives, which for us is the
    highest-numbered pin. A three-pin bus drives one wire.

    The way out is to never let convert_inverse near the buffer.
    `Buffer.write` copies raw bytes, so we pack the word ourselves --
    one 16-bit word per sample, bit per pin -- and the DMA gets exactly
    what the hardware wants. See docs/gr-iio-multipin-sink.md.

    Two consequences worth knowing:

    The buffer is allocated in `start`, not here. A sink that is
    constructed and never started must not hold the DMA, because
    building a sink and leaving the flowgraph stopped is how you set a
    static output level -- Scopy's Digital IO.

    A cyclic buffer takes exactly one push; later pushes return -EBUSY.
    So we push once and then quietly consume the rest of the stream,
    rather than pushing into an error every buffer and printing the
    `Device or resource busy` warning that gr-iio prints.
