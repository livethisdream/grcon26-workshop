"""GNU Radio blocks that treat the ADALM2000 as an instrument.

The stock IIO Device Source is general: it will talk to any IIO device on
any board, and the price is that every parameter is a name or a string you
have to already know. These blocks give that up in exchange for being
obvious. You pick a sample rate in samples per second, an input range in
volts and a trigger level in volts, and the block works out which
attribute on which of the M2K's fourteen IIO devices that means.

Nothing here needs anything beyond GNU Radio itself -- no libm2k, no
libiio Python bindings. Configuration that lives on a device other than
the streaming one is applied with gr-iio's own attribute blocks.

Only the arithmetic is re-exported here. The blocks themselves import
gnuradio, so they live in submodules and are imported directly:

    from m2k_blocks.analog_source import analog_source

That keeps `m2k_blocks.m2k_scale` importable -- and therefore testable --
on a machine with no GNU Radio at all.
