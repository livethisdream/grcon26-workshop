"""M2K Waveform Sink -- the signal generator, W1 and W2.

The generator is not the scope with the arrows reversed, and the places
it differs are the places people get caught:

    Its base clock is 75 MS/s, not 100. The rate lists do not overlap, so
    a flowgraph that generates and captures at "the same rate" is doing
    no such thing unless both were chosen deliberately.

    Its volts-to-counts conversion inverts the sign. A positive voltage
    becomes a negative count. Convert by hand and your waveform comes out
    upside down.

    W1 and W2 are separate IIO devices, m2k-dac-a and m2k-dac-b, not two
    channels of one. Picking the output picks the device.

All three are handled here so nobody has to know them.
