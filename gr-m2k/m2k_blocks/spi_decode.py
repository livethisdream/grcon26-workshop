"""SPI mode 0, decoded from three streams of levels, with nothing imported.

Kept clear of GNU Radio and of numpy on purpose, the same way
`m2k_scale` is: this is the part that has to be right, and it should be
testable on a machine with no gnuradio, no libiio, no board and no
third-party packages at all.

Mode 0 only. CPOL=0, CPHA=0 means the clock rests low, the transmitter
puts a bit on MOSI while the clock is low, and the receiver samples it
on the rising edge -- so a rising edge with chip select asserted is a
bit, and that single sentence is the whole decoder. Modes 1-3 move
which edge samples, which is a two-line change, but no capture in this
repo contains one, and an untested dropdown is worse than no dropdown.

Chip select does the framing. A byte is only worth anything if you know
where it started, and on a bus there is no start bit to find -- the
falling edge of CS is the start, and the rising edge is the end. That
also means the decoder REFUSES to emit anything until it has seen a
falling CS. A capture that begins in the middle of a frame has some
unknown number of bits already gone, and eight of the remaining ones
make a byte that is real, plausible, and wrong.

Bits arrive MSB first, which is what SPI does unless a datasheet says
otherwise, and what every M2K bench capture in this repo used.

The decoder is fed in chunks and keeps its state between them, because
a GNU Radio work() call is handed whatever happened to be in the buffer
and a frame does not care where that lands. Everything a byte in
progress needs -- the last clock level, whether CS is asserted, the
bits so far -- lives on the instance rather than in the loop.

`as_text` is the one thing in here that is not decoding. Scopy shows a
character column beside the hex and it earns its place: what proves a
loopback worked is seeing the word you typed come back out, not doing
the ASCII lookup in your head.
