"""M2K Analog Source -- the oscilloscope input, as one block.

Everything this block hides, and where it goes:

    Sample rate       oversampling_ratio on m2k-adc (100 MS/s divided down)
    Input range       gain on m2k-fabric, a DIFFERENT device from the ADC
    Trigger level     trigger_level on m2k-adc-trigger, in RAW COUNTS
    Trigger edge      trigger on m2k-adc-trigger voltage0/voltage1
    Trigger source    logic_mode on m2k-adc-trigger voltage6, plus
                      mode on voltage4/voltage5

That spread across three devices is the reason a stock Device Source
cannot do this on its own: its params go to exactly one of them.

Channel-to-attribute mapping is read out of libm2k, the library Scopy is
built on -- see iio_libm2k_fetch.py in the repository root. Values that
are not attributes at all (the volts-per-count numbers) come from
libm2k's getScalingFactor() and are marked below.
