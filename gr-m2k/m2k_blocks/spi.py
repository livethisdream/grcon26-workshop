"""The two SPI blocks -- messages to three DIO streams, and back again.

The arithmetic is `spi_encode.SpiEncoder` and `spi_decode.SpiDecoder`,
which import nothing and are tested on their own. This file is the GNU
Radio wrapper around both, and the wrapper is where the decisions live
that the pure classes have no opinion about.

The first is why the decoder's output is a message and not a stream. A
frame is hundreds of samples and carries however many bytes the message
had, so the output rate is a small fraction of the input rate -- and it
is not fixed, because CS decides how long a frame is. A sync_block
cannot express
that, and the general_work/forecast version of it spends its whole life
explaining to the scheduler how many samples it might consume. A
message port sidesteps the arithmetic entirely: bytes come out when
there are bytes, and Message Debug prints them.

The encoder's side of the same question is why it is a source with no
stream input at all. It produces idle for as long as anyone asks, which
means the Digital Sink downstream never starves between messages, and
the sink's blocking push is what paces the graph. A message arriving
mid-buffer is queued and goes out at the start of the next one.

The second is `.tolist()`. GNU Radio hands work() numpy arrays, and
element-wise indexing of a numpy array from Python is about twenty
times slower than of a list -- measured at 0.84 s versus 0.04 s per
million samples. At 1 MS/s that is the difference between using 4% of
real time and not keeping up. The conversion itself costs 0.03 s per
million, so it pays for itself many times over.
