"""Render the workshop's flowgraphs and blocks as GRC itself draws them.

The deck used to carry a hand-drawn diagram of `m2k_spi_loopback.grc`. A
diagram of a flowgraph is a second copy of it: it drifts the moment a
parameter changes, and it teaches a participant to recognise a picture rather
than the canvas they are about to sit in front of. These images come out of
GRC's own canvas code, so what is on the slide is what is on their screen --
same fonts, same colours, same port labels, same rounded corners.

No hardware and no running flowgraph: GRC parses the .grc and the block
definitions, and Cairo draws them. It never constructs a block's Python
class, so `gr-m2k` needs to be on `GRC_BLOCKS_PATH` but nothing needs to
import.

    ./slides/render_grc.py              # everything the deck uses
    ./slides/render_grc.py --list       # what is in each flowgraph
    ./slides/render_grc.py --scale 3    # denser, for print

**Uses the system interpreter,** the same way `iio_discover.py` does and for
the same reason: it needs PyGObject, which is a native binding that lands in
system site-packages where the project venv cannot see it. On Debian and
Ubuntu the packages are `gnuradio` and `gir1.2-gtk-3.0`.

Gtk needs a display to lay text out, and a headless machine has none:
