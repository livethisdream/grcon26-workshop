# The workshop deck

One HTML file, two ways to read it, and a printer.

```
xdg-open slides/index.html          # that is the whole build step
```

There is no generator, no toolchain and nothing to install. Open the file
from disk, from a web server, or from a Pages URL and it behaves the same.

## Two modes, one document

The format is [ECE 444's frame view](https://github.com/livethisdream/ece444)
ported to a standalone page. A frame is one full-viewport section; the deck is
a stack of them under `scroll-snap`.

| mode | what it is | who it is for |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **read** (default) | continuous notes, everything visible | a participant, before or after |
| **present** | one frame a screen, detail collapsed | the room |

The two are the same document. `:::{depth}` content — here, `<div class="depth">`
— is **always in the DOM**. Present mode hides it behind *More detail +*; it is
never deleted, so presenting cannot lose anything the notes carry.

A frame marked `cut` shows only its `<h2>` and its `.present` blocks on screen.
Two present blocks in one `.stage` sit side by side on a laptop and stack on a
phone: key points beside the table or the diagram they talk to.

| class | means |
| --- | --- |
| `frame cut` | has a present layer; present mode shows only that |
| `frame section-frame` | a divider — which act we are in |
| `frame read-only` | notes material, skipped by present mode *and* by the counter |
| `stage split` / `split-r` | the wider track goes left / right, for a table beside a callout |
| `present callout` | the one present block that keeps a box in both modes |

## The GRC figures are rendered, not screenshotted

Every block and canvas picture in the deck comes out of GNU Radio Companion's
own drawing code:

```
xvfb-run -a ./slides/render_grc.py          # into slides/img/
xvfb-run -a ./slides/render_grc.py --list   # block ids per flowgraph
```

It loads the same `.grc` a participant opens, asks GRC to lay it out, and
draws it to Cairo. Same fonts, same colours, same port shapes, same wire
routing — so the slide and their screen match, and a changed parameter shows
up by re-running the script rather than by somebody noticing.

Rendering a **subset** is not a crop: the named blocks are drawn into a
surface sized to their own extents, and a connection comes along when both of
its ends do. That is how a two-block figure shows the wire between them and
nothing bleeds in at the edges.

`--scale` is pixels per canvas unit and defaults to **3**. A block figure is
displayed at roughly the width of a slide column, which is wider than the
block itself, so at 2 the deck upscales it and the text goes soft.

**What it needs, and why it is not in `uv sync`.** PyGObject and GNU Radio are
native, so they live in system site-packages where the project venv cannot see
them — the script uses `#!/usr/bin/python3` for the same reason
`iio_discover.py` does. On Ubuntu 24.04:

```
sudo apt install gnuradio gir1.2-gtk-3.0
```

Gtk needs a display to lay text out, so a headless machine needs `xvfb-run`.
No board and no running flowgraph are involved: GRC parses the `.grc` and the
block YAML and never constructs a block's Python class.

One thing to know if it ever stops working: `GRC_BLOCKS_PATH` **replaces** the
search path rather than adding to it, so the script names the stock block
directory alongside `gr-m2k/grc`. Without the stock path the platform cannot
find `options` and refuses to build a library at all.

## Keys

<kbd>&rarr;</kbd> <kbd>&larr;</kbd> move · <kbd>P</kbd> present or read ·
<kbd>D</kbd> detail · <kbd>G</kbd> contents (the counter is the button; double-tap
for the top) · <kbd>L</kbd> laser · <kbd>S</kbd> spotlight · <kbd>F</kbd> fullscreen.

## Printing to PDF

**tools → print / PDF**, or <kbd>&#8984;</kbd><kbd>P</kbd>. The button switches
to read mode first, because the browser prints whatever mode the page is in and
present mode would send projector-sized type to A4.

`@media print` in `frames.css` releases the deck's fixed-height scroll container
— without that the whole deck prints as **one** page — and gives each frame
`break-after: page`, so a printed frame has room to write beside it. The depth
is always shown on paper: the handout carries the material the projected deck
does not.

Measured, not assumed: 48 frames print as 58 sheets — one each, plus the ten
where a rendered canvas and its notes run past a single side. If a change ever
makes that number 1, the print block has been overridden.

## Hosting it

`.github/workflows/pages.yml` publishes `slides/` on every push to `main`. It
needs **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions** turned on once; nothing else.

The deck is entirely self-contained apart from one Google Fonts stylesheet, and
every rule that uses it names a full fallback stack — it was checked with the
request blocked. A conference room's network is not a dependency.

## Checking a change

```
./slides/check_deck.py        # structure: titles, ids, word budgets
uv run pytest tests/test_slides.py
```

The structural check enforces what is invisible until it is wrong in front of
people: every frame has a title (or the contents overlay cannot name it), ids
are unique (or deep links land in the wrong place), a `cut` frame actually has
a present layer, no present block is over **40 words**, and no frame's present
layer is over **85**. It also asserts that every id `frames.js` reaches for by
name still exists in the markup, that every `<img>` the deck names is on disk,
and that each one has alt text.

**What it cannot check is layout.** Whether a frame fits one screen in present
mode is a question for a browser. The way to answer it:

```js
// headless, at the projector's size
const over = [];
document.querySelectorAll('.frame:not(.read-only)').forEach(f => {
  const w = f.querySelector('.wrap');
  const cs = getComputedStyle(f);
  const h = w.getBoundingClientRect().height
          + parseFloat(cs.paddingTop) + parseFloat(cs.paddingBottom);
  if (h > window.innerHeight) over.push(f.id + ' ' + Math.round(h));
});
```

Run in present mode. Every frame currently fits at 1024&times;768, 1280&times;800 and
1440&times;900, and nothing overflows horizontally at 390px. When a frame overruns,
**split it or move detail into `depth` — never cut the content.**
