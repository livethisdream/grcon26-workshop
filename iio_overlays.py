iio_overlays.py -- hand-written meaning that the ABI cannot give you.

iio_semantics.py explains everything the IIO ABI defines, which is most of
any device. What it cannot tell you is what a channel is physically wired
to. Nothing in libiio knows that `voltage0` on m2k-adc is the BNC labelled
1+ on the front of the box. That has to be written down by a person.

Everything in this file is therefore lower-trust than everything in
iio_semantics.py, and it says so. Each entry carries a `confidence`:

    UNVERIFIED  written from documentation, not yet checked against a
                real board. Renderers MUST show this as unverified.
    MEASURED    confirmed by running iio_discover.py against the
                hardware and checking the claim holds.

Promote entries to MEASURED as they get checked, and record how in the
`check` field so the next person can repeat it. Nothing here should be
taught as fact while it still says UNVERIFIED.
