iio_grc.py -- turn a discovery selection into GNU Radio block parameters.

iio_discover.py answers "what is here". iio_explain.py answers "what does
it mean". This answers the question that follows both: "what do I type
into the IIO Device Source block to get it".

It imports no libiio. It works off a snapshot, like iio_explain.py, so
the mapping can be taught anywhere.

The shapes below are read off gr-iio 3.10, not guessed:

    iio.device_source(uri, device, channels, device_phy, params,
                      buffer_size, decimation - 1)

  channels  list of channel names, one stream output each. Only scan
            elements can stream -- a channel with no scan index is
            configuration, not data.
  params    list of "<attribute name>=<value>" strings. gr-iio feeds each
            key to iio_device_identify_filename(), which wants the full
            sysfs filename: "in_voltage0_oversampling_ratio", not the bare
            "oversampling_ratio" that libiio reports against the channel.
            Restoring that prefix is what sysfs_name() is for, and it is
            the single easiest thing to get wrong by hand.
  device_phy  where params are applied, if that is not the streaming
            device itself. Left empty, gr-iio uses the streaming device.

In GRC, `uri` and `device` are string fields -- type the text bare, no
quotes. `channels` and `params` are raw fields -- type a Python list.
